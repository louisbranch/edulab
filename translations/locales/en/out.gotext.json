This guide provides step-by-step instructions on using the platform to evaluate and refine your teaching methods with evidence-based insights.\n\n---\n\n### Step 1: Set Up an Experiment\n1. **Define Your Teaching Interventions**  \n   Identify the different teaching methods or approaches you want to compare (e.g., traditional lecture vs. interactive workshops).\n   \n2. **Create Cohorts**  \n   Use EduLab's cohort feature to group students who will experience specific teaching interventions. For example:\n   - **Control**: Traditional lecture method.\n   - **Intervention**: Interactive workshop approach.\n\n3. **Develop Assessments**  \n   Design a set of pre- and post-assessment questions to measure the effectiveness of each teaching method. Ensure these questions align with the learning objectives.\n\n---\n\n### Step 2: Conduct Pre-Assessment\n- Share the pre-assessment link with your cohorts before introducing any teaching intervention. \n- Encourage students to complete the assessment to establish a baseline for their knowledge.\n\n---\n\n### Step 3: Implement Your Teaching Interventions\n- Conduct your planned teaching methods for each cohort.\n- Ensure that the interventions are distinct and well-documented for accurate comparisons.\n\n---\n\n### Step 4: Conduct Post-Assessment\n- After completing the intervention, share the post-assessment link with the same cohorts.\n- Collect responses to measure the knowledge gained through each teaching method.\n\n---\n\n### Step 5: Analyze Results\n- Use EduLab's **Learning Gain Analysis** to compare pre- and post-assessment scores within and across cohorts. This allows you to:\n  - Identify which teaching method led to higher learning gains.\n  - Understand how different demographic groups responded to the interventions.\n  \n- Utilize the demographic data to tailor future teaching methods to meet the diverse needs of your students.\n\n---\n\n### Step 6: Iterate and Refine\n- Based on the results, refine your teaching strategies to optimize learning outcomes. Repeat the process to continually improve your methods.",
